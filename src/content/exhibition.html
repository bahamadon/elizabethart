          Elizabeth Heth, a native Edmontonian, discovered a greater connection with
          history through the passing of the city centre airport into the province's
          history.  During the time in which there was some contention whether the airport
          would be closed, she found that she was receiving information from both sides
          and was intrigued by the passion and vitriol.  To explore the issue she found
          contacts who related stories regarding the airport, and the historical
          significance.  In standing on what had once been commonly known as Blatchford
          field there seemed to be an interrupt, and a suspension, in the significance of
          human history.  The aircraft were characters onto themselves with a strong
          similarity to their shorter-lived human counterparts, requiring air, fuel, care
          and purpose.  In the collection of these histories and complexities, Elizabeth
          found she was approaching these paintings less as snapshot of history and more
          as portraits, finding character and story in architecture as lovely as the
          familiar human form.
